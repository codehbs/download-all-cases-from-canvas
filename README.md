How to (easily) download all cases from Canvas

* I only tested in Chrome.
* Allow popup windows in Chrome.
* Disable your Chrome PDF Viewer plugin (Type chrome://plugins/ in Chrome. See video instructions.)
* You need to log in Canvas first.
* Go to each course's Overview page and run the script.
* You need Chrome Developer Tools. (Don’t worry! I included in video instructions.)
* Follow the weird steps to “click the hyperlink.” (See video instructions. I still don’t understand why I have to do this. May have something to do with DOM… not important. But if you figure it out, please let me know!)
